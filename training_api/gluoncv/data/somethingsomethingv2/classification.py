    """Load the Something-Something-V2 video action recognition dataset.

    Refer to :doc:`../build/examples_datasets/somethingsomethingv2` for the description of
    this dataset and how to prepare it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    root : str, required. Default '~/.mxnet/datasets/somethingsomethingv2/20bn-something-something-v2-frames'.
        Path to the root folder storing the dataset.
    setting : str, required.
        A text file describing the dataset, each line per video sample.
        There are three items in each line: (1) video path; (2) video length and (3) video label.
    train : bool, default True.
        Whether to load the training or validation set.
    test_mode : bool, default False.
        Whether to perform evaluation on the test set.
        Usually there is three-crop or ten-crop evaluation strategy involved.
    name_pattern : str, default None.
        The naming pattern of the decoded video frames.
        For example, 000012.jpg.
    video_ext : str, default 'mp4'.
        If video_loader is set to True, please specify the video format accordinly.
    is_color : bool, default True.
        Whether the loaded image is color or grayscale.
    modality : str, default 'rgb'.
        Input modalities, we support only rgb video frames for now.
        Will add support for rgb difference image and optical flow image later.
    num_segments : int, default 1.
        Number of segments to evenly divide the video into clips.
        A useful technique to obtain global video-level information.
        Limin Wang, etal, Temporal Segment Networks: Towards Good Practices for Deep Action Recognition, ECCV 2016.
    num_crop : int, default 1.
        Number of crops for each image. default is 1.
        Common choices are three crops and ten crops during evaluation.
    new_length : int, default 1.
        The length of input video clip. Default is a single image, but it can be multiple video frames.
        For example, new_length=16 means we will extract a video clip of consecutive 16 frames.
    new_step : int, default 1.
        Temporal sampling rate. For example, new_step=1 means we will extract a video clip of consecutive frames.
        new_step=2 means we will extract a video clip of every other frame.
    new_width : int, default 340.
        Scale the width of loaded image to 'new_width' for later multiscale cropping and resizing.
    new_height : int, default 256.
        Scale the height of loaded image to 'new_height' for later multiscale cropping and resizing.
    target_width : int, default 224.
        Scale the width of transformed image to the same 'target_width' for batch forwarding.
    target_height : int, default 224.
        Scale the height of transformed image to the same 'target_height' for batch forwarding.
    temporal_jitter : bool, default False.
        Whether to temporally jitter if new_step > 1.
    video_loader : bool, default False.
        Whether to use video loader to load data.
    use_decord : bool, default True.
        Whether to use Decord video loader to load data. Otherwise use mmcv video loader.
    transform : function, default None.
        A function that takes data and label and transforms them.
    slowfast : bool, default False.
        If set to True, use data loader designed for SlowFast network.
        Christoph Feichtenhofer, etal, SlowFast Networks for Video Recognition, ICCV 2019.
    slow_temporal_stride : int, default 16.
        The temporal stride for sparse sampling of video frames in slow branch of a SlowFast network.
    fast_temporal_stride : int, default 2.
        The temporal stride for sparse sampling of video frames in fast branch of a SlowFast network.
    data_aug : str, default 'v1'.
        Different types of data augmentation auto. Supports v1, v2, v3 and v4.
    lazy_init : bool, default False.
        If set to True, build a dataset instance without loading any dataset.
